The battlefield is more than just a physical space; it is a living entity that can be manipulated to your advantage. When preparing for battle, I always conduct a meticulous reconnaissance of the land, noting the elevation, natural obstacles, and potential choke points. A well-informed commander can use the terrain to funnel enemy forces into a disadvantageous position or create advantageous flanking maneuvers.</p>',
