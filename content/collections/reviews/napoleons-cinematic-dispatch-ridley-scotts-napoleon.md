title: "Napoleon's Cinematic Dispatch: Ridley Scott’s Napoleon"
score: 6
excerpt: 'Ridley Scott’s Napoleon is, I suppose, what one might expect from a Hollywood epic—grand, dramatic, and larger than life, yet still missing the finer details. He gives the audience a glimpse of my glory, but only a glimpse. The complexity of my mind, the intricacies of my plans, the true depth of my ambition—these are but shadows in his film. I suppose I must live with the fact that no movie can truly capture the immensity of my life and achievements in a mere two hours.'

    title: 'My dear readers,'
    text: '<p>It has come to my attention that the esteemed director Ridley Scott, a man known for his ability to bring great epics to the screen, has dared to produce a film that bears my name. Naturally, I approached this project with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism. After all, how many times must I endure the endless parade of filmmakers and authors who claim to &quot;understand&quot; me, yet fail to capture the essence of who I am? I am no simple general, no mere man of the battlefield, and yet they always reduce me to one or the other.</p>'

    text: '<p>Let me begin with the actor chosen to portray me, Joaquin Phoenix. Ah, Joaquin! There is something in his eyes, a brooding intensity, which I admit stirred a flicker of recognition within me. He grasps the ambition, the sheer force of will that drove me to conquer Europe, though at times he seems to dwell a bit too much on my darker moods. Yes, I could be brooding, especially when surrounded by incompetence, but I was also a man of vision, wit, and charm! Did the film capture my charm? Not nearly enough, I fear.</p>'

    text: '<p>The cinematography is magnificent. The battles—Austerlitz, for instance—are brought to life with the full force of modern technology. The chaos, the smoke, the clash of steel, all beautifully rendered. But I must ask, where is the elegance of my strategy? My battlefield genius is not in the spectacle of cannons and cavalry alone. It is in the meticulous planning, the way I could outthink my enemies before a single shot was fired. Scott shows me fighting like a lion, but does he show me thinking like a chess master? Only in fleeting moments.</p>'

    text: '<p>Ah, and then there is Josephine. I must say, Vanessa Kirby captures her allure, though I wonder if the film focuses a bit too much on our tumultuous relationship. Josephine was indeed the love of my life, but she was also a source of constant frustration. Scott’s film paints our marriage as a passionate, almost Shakespearean affair, but I ask you—where are the subtleties? Josephine was cunning, ambitious in her own right, and our relationship was not just about love but power. I had empires to manage, yet the film suggests my heart was always with her. Flattering, perhaps, but simplistic.</p>'

    text: '<p>The political complexities of my reign are somewhat glossed over in favor of action and spectacle, but this, I understand, is the nature of cinema. The subtleties of the Napoleonic Code or my reforms to education are perhaps less thrilling to the average viewer than a cavalry charge, but it is in these reforms that my true legacy lies. Will the audience remember me as a man of vision or merely as a conqueror? I suppose that is the eternal question.</p>'

    text: '<p>One particularly irksome detail: my height. Yes, we must address it. Ridley Scott, to his credit, does not make a farce of the long-standing myth that I was short, but he also does little to dispel it. I was of average height for my time! Let us set the record straight once and for all.</p>'

For that, Ridley Scott, I tip my hat. You may have failed to capture the full measure of me, but at least you tried. That is more than can be said for most.</p>'
