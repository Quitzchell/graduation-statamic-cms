title: "Napoleon's Verdict: A Review of Waterloo"
score: 9
excerpt: 'Waterloo is a film that seeks to immortalize my greatest defeat, and while it succeeds in its spectacle, it falters in portraying the true depth of my command and the complexity of my choices. The battle of Waterloo was not simply a brawl between two massive armies. It was a finely orchestrated chess game. The film captures the chaos of war, but it misses the precision of command.'

    title: 'My dear readers,'
    text: '<p>It is with a curious heart that I approached <em>Waterloo</em>—a film that attempts to dramatize the final chapter of my military career. Sergei Bondarchuk, the director, has taken upon himself the daunting task of recreating the climactic battle that sealed my fate, a moment that has been dissected and debated by historians for generations. Could a mere film possibly capture the scale, the strategy, and the sheer weight of what transpired on that fateful day in June 1815? As ever, I was skeptical, yet intrigued.</p>'

    text: '<p>Let me begin with the portrayal of myself, for that is naturally the crux of the matter. Rod Steiger, the actor chosen to embody me, gives a performance that swings between brilliance and melodrama. There are moments when he captures the force of my personality—my iron will, my command over men, the burning fire of ambition that drove me across Europe. But then, there are times when he descends into theatrical excess. Steiger’s Napoleon is too often a man burdened by self-pity, his melancholy stretched too far. I was never a man to wallow in defeat before the battle was lost! Even in my darkest hour, I believed in victory. Steiger shows flashes of that drive, but not consistently enough for my taste.</p>'

    text: '<p>As for the battle scenes, Bondarchuk must be commended for his ambition. The scale is impressive—the cavalry charges, the infantry formations, the sheer spectacle of tens of thousands of men clashing on the fields of Waterloo. I could almost smell the gunpowder, feel the thunder of the horses beneath me once again. Yet, I must ask, where is the elegance of my strategy? The battle of Waterloo was not simply a brawl between two massive armies. It was a finely orchestrated chess game. My marshals, my placement of troops, my choice of the battlefield—all of this is glossed over in favor of spectacle. The film captures the chaos of war, but it misses the precision of command.</p>'

    text: '<p>Ah, and Wellington! Christopher Plummer’s Duke of Wellington is an admirable foe. Plummer portrays him as cool, detached, ever-calculating. It is true that Wellington was a worthy adversary, though the film portrays him with a level of heroic calm that I find rather amusing. He was a brilliant tactician, yes, but on that day, he was also a man clinging to the edge of defeat before the Prussians arrived. Still, Plummer does him justice.</p>'

    text: '<p>One moment that irked me was the film&#039;s portrayal of my fateful hesitation on the battlefield, where it suggests I delayed sending in the Imperial Guard. Yes, timing is everything in war, but the reasons for my decisions are far more complex than mere hesitation. The film reduces a moment of calculated risk into something akin to doubt. Let me assure you, I did not hesitate out of fear. The battlefield was a maelstrom, and the timing of every move was critical. To suggest that I faltered is to misunderstand the dynamics of command.</p>'

    text: '<p>However, <em>Waterloo</em> is not without its merits. The film, despite its theatrical tendencies, evokes a sense of grandeur befitting the end of an era. The costumes, the sets, the landscapes—all are meticulously crafted. There is an air of finality to the film that echoes the gravity of the battle itself. But what it lacks, I believe, is the nuance of my mind. Bondarchuk captures the end of Napoleon the Emperor, but not Napoleon the strategist.</p>'

Still, I appreciate the effort to preserve this decisive moment in history. It is, after all, the battle that the world remembers, even if the reasons for its outcome remain misunderstood by many.</p>'
